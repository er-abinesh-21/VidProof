# VidProof ‚Äì AI-Powered CCTV Video Authenticity Checker

VidProof is a modern web application designed to analyze video files and generate detailed authenticity reports. Users can upload video footage, and the application performs a client-side analysis to detect potential signs of tampering, providing a comprehensive summary, an authenticity score, and a list of specific findings.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Secure User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and password reset functionality powered by Supabase Auth.
*   **Client-Side Video Analysis**: All analysis is performed directly in the browser using FFmpeg (compiled to WebAssembly), ensuring user privacy as videos are never uploaded to a server.
*   **Comprehensive Reports**: Each analysis generates a detailed report including:
    *   An **Authenticity Score** (0-100) visualized in a dynamic circular progress bar.
    *   A clear, concise **Summary** of the findings.
    *   A **Detailed List of Issues** with timestamps and severity levels (low, medium, high).
*   **In-Depth Analysis Checks**:
    *   **Metadata Inspection**: Verifies video duration and stream information.
    *   **Frame Comparison**: Extracts frames from different points in the video and compares them to detect static or unnaturally similar segments.
    *   **Audio Analysis**: Detects the presence of an audio stream and identifies periods of silence that could indicate editing.
*   **Persistent Report History**: All generated reports are saved to the user's account and can be accessed anytime from the "My Reports" page.
*   **PDF Export**: Download any report as a professionally formatted PDF document for offline access or sharing.
*   **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern, and fully responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **User Profile Management**: Users can view and update their personal information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, client-centric technology stack.

*   **Frontend**:
    *   **Framework**: React (with Vite)
    *   **Language**: TypeScript
    *   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui
    *   **Routing**: React Router
    *   **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query
*   **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)**:
    *   **Provider**: Supabase
    *   **Services**: Authentication, PostgreSQL Database (for user profiles and reports).
*   **Core Libraries**:
    *   **Video Processing**: `ffmpeg.wasm` for in-browser video analysis.
    *   **Image Comparison**: `pixelmatch` for detecting differences between video frames.
    *   **PDF Generation**: `jspdf` and `html2canvas` for creating downloadable reports.
    *   **UI Components**: `lucide-react` for icons.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The video analysis process is unique because it happens entirely on the client-side, prioritizing user privacy and security.

1.  **Upload**: The user selects or drags-and-drops a video file into the application.
2.  **In-Browser Engine**: The application loads the FFmpeg library, compiled to WebAssembly, into the browser.
3.  **Analysis**: FFmpeg runs directly in the browser to perform a series of checks on the video file without uploading it anywhere. This includes extracting metadata, audio streams, and individual frames.
4.  **Report Generation**: Based on the analysis, a JSON report is created, calculating the authenticity score and summarizing all findings.
5.  **Data Persistence**: The generated report is then saved to the Supabase database, linked to the authenticated user's ID.
6.  **Display & Download**: The user is redirected to a detailed report page where they can view the results and download a PDF copy.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/er-abinesh-21/VidProof.git
    cd VidProof
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Supabase:**
    *   Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project.
    *   Navigate to **Project Settings** > **API**.
    *   Find your **Project URL** and **anon (public) key**.
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase credentials:
        ```
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
        ```
    *   In the Supabase dashboard, go to the **SQL Editor** and run the SQL queries needed to create the `profiles` and `reports` tables, along with their respective policies and the `handle_new_user` function. The required schema is based on the application's interactions with the database.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.
